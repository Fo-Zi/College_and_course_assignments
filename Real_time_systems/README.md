# Real Time Systems
## Summary
Hi everyone! In this folder you'll find some of the assignments I've done in order to pass the course imparted by the EIT on Coursera. The tools and topics were:
- Preemptive Scheduling theory.
- Scheduling simulation using [SimSo](https://projects.laas.fr/simso/).
- [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/) basics.

#### Thanks for passing by!
