# Assembly assignment for an Arduino UNO board
## Summary
Hi everyone! This code comes from an assignment i did a couple of years ago for a college course in which we were learning the basics of microcontrollers architecture, so we had to do some assembly programming. There are three simple codes:
- LED Blinking: Using a blocking state, and non-blocking one.
- The generation of pseudo-aleatory numbers and ordering the resulting vector.

There's also the report I wrote at the time, so any Spanish speakers that want to look into it are welcome!

#### Thanks for passing by!
