# Linux Concurrent Server -> Text based card game
## Summary
Hi everyone! This code comes from an assignment i did a couple of years ago so it doesn't follow SOLID principles, at that time i didn't know much about Software Engineering or good programming practices. But there are a couple of interesting and advanced concepts applied like:
- IPC mechanisms: Shared Memory, Message Queues, Signals.
- Basics of networking and TCP sockets.
- Process creation and handling in Linux.

If you want to try the game you can use [netcat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat) to emulate a client.
There's also the report I wrote at the time, so any Spanish speaker that wants to look into it are welcome!

#### Thanks for passing by!
